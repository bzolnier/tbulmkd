kernel/add-tbulmkd-entries.patch needs to be applied to the kernel
that would be used with tbulmkd.  It adds /proc/$pid/activity and
/proc/$pid/activity_time files.  Write '0' to activity file to mark
the process as background one and '1' (the default value) to mark
it as foreground one.  Please note that this interface is just for
a demonstration of tbulmkd functionality and will be changed in
the future.

Use 'make' to build tbulmkd and proxy_shm programs (please remember
that proxy_shm needs to be run before tbulmkd).
